This is going on a machine that authenticates continously over the network.  It connects to another machine (which will be running server.py) on a port (9125), authenticates, then gets given a password encrypted with a session key.  THIS DEPENDS ON PYTHON AND ON TWISTED.

Solution:  lots of solutions.  One solution is sniffing; if you can get the unencrypted network traffic, you win.  That SHOULD be possible using nothing more special than wireshark; maybe we ought to install wireshark on our EC2s.
