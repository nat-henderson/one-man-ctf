This problem simulates a vulnerable password recovery service. When sent an
email from an accounts email address (<account_name>@<computer_name>), the
service replies with that accounts password.

SOLUTION:
The weakness of the program (besides the fact that it's storing the password in
plain-text) is that, while it checks the "From" header to get the registered
email address, it replies to the message. Like a normal reply, this uses the
"Reply-To" header instead of the From header. The player needs to send an SMTP
message to the server, using something like Netcat or Telnet, with a From
header of the account they want the password of and with a Reply-To header of
an email address they control.
