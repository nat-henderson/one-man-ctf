The point of this one is that it makes your effective userid into that of the user who owns the file corresponding to the next level.

When we finally get all the useraccounts set up, the thing we'll need to do is change to be the user corresponding to the next level, then chmod ug+s executable-name.  We'll also need to chown the password.txt file to belong to the next level.

The solution:  change the PATH so that "date" redirects to the player's executable (conveniently, the player's executable is 'cat password.txt' or something).
